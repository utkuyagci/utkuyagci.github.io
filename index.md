Hi, I'm Utku. Welcome to my project portfolio. I recently graduated from [METU](https://www.metu.edu.tr/) as an industrial engineer with a minor in economics, and I am looking for work as a machine learning engineer.

Major projects I have accomplished can be found here.

## Projects

#### ReBERT Hate Speech Detector 
This project addresses the challenge of hate speech detection in Arabic and Turkish tweets using pre-trained BERT models: TurkishBERTweet and Arabertv02-twitter. These models undergo extensive fine-tuning to enhance their performance. Notably, both classifiers achieved significant success in the HSD2Lang 2024 contest, with the Arabic model securing **first** place and the Turkish model ranking **second** on the leaderboard.

 The findings and methodologies of this project have been published at #EACL 2024 (European Association for Computational Linguistics) in the conference paper titled "ReBERT at HSD-2Lang 2024: Fine-Tuning BERT with AdamW for Hate Speech Detection in Arabic and Turkish".
 
#### Time Series Forecasting With Neural Networks Using KDE Estimator
This project focuses on time series forecasting of electricity generation using neural network models, specifically multilayer perceptron (MLP) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. A notable aspect of this project is the utilization of the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) estimator for ensembling the forecast outcomes generated from multiple initializations of the neural networks. 

The incorporation of the KDE estimator aimed to mitigate the inherent randomness resulting from neural network initializations, thereby reducing prediction variability and enhancing forecast reliability. Extensive analysis was carried out in the project, comparing results from 30 to 100 initializations of the models, and also contrasting these outcomes with those obtained from traditional ensemble methods such as mean and median ensembles.

The project offers insights into the effectiveness of neural network models in time series forecasting tasks and demonstrates the value of employing advanced techniques like the KDE estimator for enhancing prediction accuracy and stability. Furthermore, by evaluating and comparing various initialization schemes and ensemble methods, this project contributes to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing the performance of neural network-based forecasting models in real-world applications.
